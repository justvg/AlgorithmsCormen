This repository contains my implementation of some of the algorithms from "Introduction to Algorithms" book. I know that these algorithms can be more efficient, but the main goal is not to write the most efficient ones but just to get familiar with them.<br/>
<br/>

At the moment file Sorts.cpp contains implementations of: InsertionSort, SelectionSort, MergeSort and BinarySearch; binary_heap, max-priority queue, Heap Sort; QuickSort, RandomizedQuickSort, HoareQuickSort; CountingSort, RadixSort, BucketSort. <br/>
<br/>

At the moment file DataStructures.cpp contains implementations of:  Stack, Queue, Linked List; Binary Tree, Tree; Chained Hash Table, Open Addressing Hash Table; Binary Search Tree; some of Red-Black Tree<br/>
<br/>

At the moment file Graphs.cpp contains implementations of:  Graph, BFS, DFS; Minimum Spanning Tree, Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.<br/>
